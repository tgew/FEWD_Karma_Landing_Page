   "We do it by weaving conductive threads into fabric."

The special threads could be woven into an array of fabrics, and be made to visually stand out or go unnoticed, depending on designers' wishes. Conductivity could be limited to desired parts of fabric or spread across entire cloth.


"It is stretchable. It is washable," Karagozler said, as people controlled lights or computer screens with finger strokes on a blue cloth covering a table behind him. "It is just like normal fabric."

Google said Project Jacquard made it possible to weave touch and gesture interactivity into any textile using standard, industrial looms.

Anything involving fabric, from suits or dresses to furniture or carpet, could have computer touchpad-style control capabilities woven in.

Conductive yarn was connected to tiny circuits, no bigger than jacket buttons, with miniaturised electronics that could use algorithms to recognise touches or swipes, the team said.
